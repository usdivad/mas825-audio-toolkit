## Examples
- **hyperproduction_examples**:
    - fader_to_osc_basic.hpm - sends the fader value on OSC address `addr1`
    - keyboard_input_to_midi_basic.hpm - sends keystrokes' [`keyCode` values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode) as MIDI notes
    - keyboard_input_to_midi_scale.hpm - sends keystrokes as MIDI notes along a C major scale, so you can play it like a piano! Mimics Logic's [musical typing](https://www.dummies.com/software/logic-pro-x/how-to-record-midi-in-logic-pro-x-with-musical-typing/) feature:
        - `asdfghjkl;'` = white keys
        - `wetyuop` = black keys
    - keyboard_input_to_osc_basic.hpm - sends keystrokes `0123456789` as OSC values, in gradations from 0-1, at OSC address `addr1`

- **reaper_project_example**:
    - reaper_project_example.RPP - an example Reaper project, with one synth and one audio track. The audio track's pitch-shifting and the synth's square mix are controlled via OSC by messages received at `addr1`
    - cicadas.mp3 - the audio clip referenced in the project
